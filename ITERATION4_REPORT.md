Iteration 4 Report  
*5.2.14*  

# Difficulties
In general, we had difficulties coming up with a coherent UI style for the event, user, and club profiles. We were going back and forth about how to display the information in a way that makes logical sense and looks pleasant. In the end, we came up with a style that displayed the data in a more meaningful way.

For the club team, the main difficulties were in getting the css/less correctly without affecting other pages. The other challenge was in deciding how to restrict an admin from demoting the only/last admin of the club. In the end, we decided to still display the demote button but show a message telling the admin that they can't demote the only admin of the club.
