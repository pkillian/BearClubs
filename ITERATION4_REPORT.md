Iteration 4 Report  
*5.2.14*  

# Difficulties
In general, we had difficulties coming up with a coherent UI style for the event, user, and club profiles. We were going back and forth about how to display the information in a way that makes logical sense and looks pleasant. In the end, we came up with a style that displayed the data in a more meaningful way.

For the club team, the main difficulties were in getting the css/less correctly without affecting other pages. The other challenge was in deciding how to restrict an admin from demoting the only/last admin of the club. In the end, we decided to still display the demote button but show a message telling the admin that they can't demote the only admin of the club.

For the event team, the main difficulties were keeping the style consistent with the other profile pages. Now the profile displays the users name on the subscribed users list on the right as soon as the user clicks the subcscribe button.
