# BearClubs

A tool for connecting students and organizations at UC Berkeley.

## Customer
Customers for this application will be all those who are interested or are involved in student organizations and clubs on campus. Specifically, there will be three types of customers: club officers, current members, and students who are interested in joining clubs. 

Officers will be able to use this application as a tool to advertise their club and keep members up-to-date on all events and information. Current members will be able to keep track of multiple events across different clubs and communicate with other members. Students interested in joining clubs will be able to browse a listing of all organizations and clubs on campus, learn more about each club and their events, and apply for clubs. 

We intend to contact a few clubs on campus as our specific customers who will provide feedback and suggestions as we build the application. We will also be customers involved in this process, acting as current members and those interested in joining clubs.
