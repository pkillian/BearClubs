# BearClubs

A tool for connecting students and organizations at UC Berkeley.

## Project Abstract

## Customer
Customers for this application will be all those who are interested or are involved in student organizations and clubs on campus. Specifically, there will be three types of customers: club officers, current members, and students who are interested in joining clubs. 

Officers will be able to use this application as a tool to advertise their club and keep members up-to-date on all events and information. Current members will be able to keep track of multiple events across different clubs and communicate with other members. Students interested in joining clubs will be able to browse a listing of all organizations and clubs on campus, learn more about each club and their events, and apply for clubs. 

We intend to contact a few clubs on campus as our specific customers who will provide feedback and suggestions as we build the application. We will also be customers involved in this process, acting as current members and those interested in joining clubs.

## Competitive Landscape
Our main competitor in the UC Berkeley market will be the existing Berkeley solution: CalLink. CalLink, in recent years, is and has been the only way for Berkeley students to find clubs and events to attend. However, CalLink is highly inefficient. The site (callink.berkeley.edu) is cluttered and outdated in terms of information. For instance, to join and find organizations to join, one needs to sort through 1,452 organizations with many of these being inactive. Furthermore, some of the currently active organizations don't even work with CalLink to keep their events updated. As students of Berkeley, we want to better engage with the Cal community, but CalLink doesn't effectively allow us to do that.

For the most part, BearClubs will keep the core idea of CalLink but make major improvements and enhancements to it. We want to provide a clean, simple UI that not only allows students to find organizations and events easily, but also allows current members to stay updated with their clubs. Some features that we are implementing to differentiate from CalLink are: individual user profiles which provide the ability for users to follow organizations their interested in, administrative privileges for officer club members so they can better manage their club, and a club search system that incorporates the use of tags to better facilitate and simplify the discovery process for new users. In essence, BearClubs will strive to be the go-to place for students and organizations.
